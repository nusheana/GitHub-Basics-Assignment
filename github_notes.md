# What I Learned in GitHub Basics
- I learned how to create a repository.
- I learned how to clone a repository.
- I learned about branches, commits, and pull requests.

## Questions I Still Have:
- Whatâ€™s the best way to manage multiple branches?
- How do I collaborate with others on GitHub?
- This was so challenging and difficult need help and to try multiple times as I feel lost still
